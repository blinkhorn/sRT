![alt text](./images/app-image-3.png "App image — result button")
![alt text](./images/app-image-4.png "App image — result")

## Features

- UI that lets the user go through a series of coices to find the right song for them
- Server that searches the database for and displays the right song based on the        user's input

## Technologies Used

sRT uses an Angular front-end and Node.js backend along with Sequelize and a PostgreSQL database.
